## Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Any% Glitched(Early Abra) Route
Prepared by Ananan#8613

Ported to Ranger by HunarPG#2786

Please DM me if you have any issues!

Credits for these notes:
  - Ananan for making the route

A couple things before with this route:
  - You need Mr Mime to be Level 33(to learn Recycle) and Farfetch'd to be level 21(to learn Knock Off) which makes this glitch possible
  - You need to be very catious with the ev's your Mr Mime gets so fighting any extra trainers not in the route will surely mess up routing
  - Ev's you need on Mime before the double battle are 83 HP EV's and 20 Atk ev's(other Ev's don't matter)
  - You will be picking an Oran Berry on Route 25 make sure to not use it as it's needed for the glitch
  - You need 7 mons to beat the game:
    - Out of which 4 are same every run which are the Starter(Squirtle), Magikarp(Bought on Route 4 Pokemon Center), Abra(traded for Mr.Mime) and lastly Spearow(traded for Farfetch'd)
    - And other 3 mons are :- A Level 10 mon from Route 4 which needed fo abra repel manip(sandshrew/ekans/rattata/spearow) and 2 filler mons
    - Out of 2 filler mons one of them is your cut user but if your level 10 mon is your cut user(sandshrew/rattata) then you can catch any random mon
    - And the 2nd mon can be any mon you encounter
    - For a cut mon I would higly recommend just getting a Rattata from Route 1 and not worry about not getting rattata/sandshrew from route 10 but bellspout/oddish can also be a consideration which can be caught on the same route where abra is caught another good option you can eaisly get is Diglett(as you always go through diglett's cave)
    - While the 2nd random move can be anything catching Pidgey(Route 1) or catching Caterpie(Viridian Forest) is quite easy

Before starting your run, make sure your save file has the following:
  - Text: Fast
  - Battle Animations: Off
  - Style: Set
  - Button Mode: L=A

If the route does not say to learn a move explicitly, do not learn it.

Download the RNG Manip program and set the following IV restrictions:
  - Frame window: 4000 to 5500
  - Natures: Rash,Mild or Modest
  - HP: x
  - Atk: 21 / 4 / x
  - Def: 7 / x / x
  - Sp. Atk: x / x / 30
  - Sp. Def: 5 / x / X
  - Spe: x / 21 / x

Give yourself a 1 character name (manip time starts when you confirm your name)

Give your rival a 1 character name

Check and insert your Trainer ID into the RNG Manipulation Program

Head outside then head north towards the grass have Oak stop you

Mash through text until you can pick and manipulate Squirtle. Give it a one character name

Head down and fight your rival

:::trainer[Rival 1]
  - Tackle spam
  - Tail Whip turn 1 if Modest or 0-3 Atk Rash/Mild

    :::if{source="Squirtle" condition="atk=(0-31 / 0-23 / x)"}
    - Tail Whip x2 if turn one Growl
    :::
    :::if{source="Squirtle" condition="atk=(x / 24-31 / x)"}
    - Tail Whip x2 if turn two/three Growl
    :::
:::

Enter your IVs into Ranger.
  - Left-click on "SP ATK" to force plus Attack nature
  - Shift + Left-click on either "DEF" (Mild), "SP.DEF" (Rash) or "Attack" (Modest)

Exit the lab and head to Route 1

Grab the potion from mart guy(optional)

Kill any level 2 or 3 Pidgey/Rattata along the way
  - Don’t kill a lv 3 Pidgey if Modest or less than 21 Attack
  - If 31 IV speed,modest or prefer safety attempt to kill an extra Pidgey/Rattata on Route 1 

Grab the parcel at the mart then head back to Oak’s lab

Catch Rattata and Pidgey if you come across them (tackle once to weaken)
  - Don’t try to force an encounter since there’s backups later

On Route 2, cut through the grass before the Viridian Forest entrance (2nd tile to the right); it is 1% to get an encounter

Avoid all non mandatory trainers
  - Fight the third optional bug catcher

Grab this hidden potion if necessary

Enter the house East of Fan Club and Trade Spearow for Farfetch'd
  - Make sure to go to Pokemon Center and withdraw Spearow instead of one of your mons(also Box Heal Mr Mime)

Now Head towards the double battle

:::::::::

Now Candy x2 Mr Mime to Level 33 and teach Recycle over the 4th Move(Meditate)

Now put a mon with less than Half HP in front of the party(preferably Wartortle)
  - Put Farfetch'd in the Second SLat of the party
  - Give Wartortle Oran Berry(Sitrus if you don't have Oran)
  - Give Mr Mime Retro Mail 
  - Save(optional)

Start the Double battle

Bubble With Wartortle(Any move if not using Wartortle)
  - Click Leer/Sand Attack with Farfetch'd
  - Wartortle would have it's Oran/Sitrus Berry consumed

Switch to Mr Mime on Wartortle Slot
  - Knock Off Wartortle Slot from Farfetch'd
  - Retro Mail from Mr Mime would now be Knock Offed

Use Recycle with Mr Mime
  - Use Any move with Farfetch'd
  - Stall till Mr Mime get to use Recycle

After Mr Mime has used recycle and recovered Oran/Sitrus Berry Kill both mons as fast as possibl
  - Mr Mime has Magical Leaf if Clefairy uses too many Minimizes

Now after the battle is done giver every mon Retro Mail(excpet Mr Mime)
  - Now Give Mr Mime the HP Up
  - Now Give Mr Mime Mail 7 times(Hp Ups will start cloning and you need 7 of them so your HP EV is correct)

After Cloning is done use all 7 HP Ups and Protein on Mr Mime
  - Head to Lavander Pokemon Center

Take out the Mon deposited at time to withdrawing Spearow
  - Replace it with Mr Mime and put Mr Mime in Box 3 Slot 1

Now Start naming box 3, 2 and 1 to(The names of the boxes are in brackets and the sentence next to them is explanation)

Box 3 = (...o)               Here the charcater with 3 dots is a seperate character on 3rd page in naming window and tere is no gap after o just type 2 characters
Box 2 = ( ?"h ?nO)           Here there are 2 empty spaces first is the first character and second is between h and ?
Box 1 = (dS-nVQ?n)           Here there is no gaps in the box name

Here is how box names look :-

Now give the mon you just withdrew Retro Mail with Wandering written on 2nd slot of the mail(Use Select to switch to character based search)

Like this =

Now withdraw Mail from every mon except the one in front of the party(you could do any but front is faster so you can mash A to deposit)
  - Also the mon you gave wandering mail to will have no item shown so don't do anything with that mon
  - Now Deposit all mon except the first one in Box 1

Now go to Move Pokemon and go to Box 3
  - Mr Mime sprite will be replaced by a Question Mark
  - Pick it up and take it to Box 1
  - Replace it with any mon in Box 1 twice and your should start saving like you entered hall of fame
